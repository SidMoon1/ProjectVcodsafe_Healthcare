# ProjectVcodsafe_Healthcare
Java-based web app on Healthcare Management

## Project Overview

The **Online Healthcare Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline healthcare services by connecting patients, doctors, and administrative staff in an efficient and user-friendly way. The system provides patients with the ability to register, book appointments, and view billing details. Doctors can manage their schedules, view patient information, and track appointments. The project utilizes a RESTful API to connect the front-end with a Spring Boot-based backend and a MySQL database to handle data storage.

The goal of this project is to make healthcare management more efficient and accessible by reducing manual tasks and enhancing interaction between patients and healthcare providers. This document will guide you through the project’s setup, structure, and functionality.

## Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Register, view, and manage patient records.
- **Doctor Management**: Add doctors, manage schedules, and update specialties.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, view, and cancel appointments.
- **Billing Management**: Generate, update, and view billing details for each appointment.
- **RESTful API**: Secure communication between frontend, backend, and database.
- **Database Storage**: All data related to patients, doctors, appointments, and billing is stored in MySQL.

## How the System Works

### Project Workflow

1. **Patient Registration and Login**: Patients can register by providing basic details (name, age, contact information). Once registered, patients can log in to the system and access features such as booking appointments and viewing bills.

2. **Doctor Management**: Administrators can add doctors to the system, specifying details like name, specialty, and availability. Doctors can access the platform to view their schedule and appointment details.

3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can search for available doctors and book appointments. When an appointment is booked, it’s recorded in the system with details such as the date, doctor, and patient.

4. **Billing Management**: Once an appointment is completed, the system generates a bill. Patients can view their bills, and administrators can update billing statuses as payments are processed.

5. **Data Management and Security**: A RESTful API handles data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring secure and efficient communication. All data is stored in a MySQL database, which organizes information for easy retrieval and management.
